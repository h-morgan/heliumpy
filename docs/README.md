# hntpy Documentation

This is the documentation and usage instructions for the `hntpy` Python package. If you need to install it or view package information, head over to the official package page on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/hntpy/#description).

## Introduction

`hntpy` is a Python package created to enable easy interaction with the Helium API. For further information about the Helium API, including information about requests and responses, view their [API documentation](https://docs.helium.com/api/blockchain/introduction).

To use this module, you need to import the parts you intend to use into your Python file. So far, we have the following modules that can be imported/used to make requests:

- `Account`
- `Hotspot`

An example of importing both of these would look like:

```python
from hntpy import Account, Hotspot
```

For specific information and more comprehensive examples of using these modules, see their respective documentation pages:

- [`Account` docs]
- [`Hotspot` docs]
